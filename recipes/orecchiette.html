    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>It's one of those dishes I always come back to for more. Best thing is, there is room to tweak it a bit to suit your style. The type of sausage you use will greatly affect the taste of the whole dish. I'm partial to Sicilian-style chicken sausage for this recipe. Garnish each bowl with Parmesan cheese.    </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
        </li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced
        </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package chopped pancetta
        </li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package Italian chicken sausage (such as Trader Joe's® Chicken Sicilian Sausage)
        </li>
        <li>⅓ cup red wine
        </li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package crimini mushrooms, sliced
        </li>
        <li>20 cherry tomatoes, halved, or more to taste
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
        </li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package orecchiette pasta
        </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped baby spinach
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion starts to soften, about 2 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Increase heat to high and add pancetta to the skillet. Cook and stir until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove casings from the sausages; add sausage meat to skillet. Cook and stir until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in wine and scrape the bottom of the skillet.

        </li>
        <li>Toss mushrooms into the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, basil, oregano, and salt. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thick, 1 to 2 hours.

        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in orecchiette and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of cooking water and drain without rinsing the pasta.

        </li>
        <li>Stir spinach into the sauce in the skillet. Cook until wilted, about 1 minute. Toss pasta into the skillet and stir to combine everything. Stir until heated through, adding some reserved pasta water if the sauce seems too thick.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3><strong><em>Good luck!!!</em></strong></h3>
