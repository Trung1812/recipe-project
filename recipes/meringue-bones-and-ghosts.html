    <p>While I know no one is ever actually scared by spooky Halloween treats, I do know for a fact that many people are terrified to work with meringue. Hopefully these bones and ghosts will help chase those demons away.</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 large egg whites        </li>
        <li>    2 large egg whites        </li>
        <li>   7 tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste        </li>
        <li>  2 chocolate chips, melted, or as needed        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone baking mats.        </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs whites and lemon juice together in a bowl until thick, white, and foamy. Add sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking constantly, until meringue is shiny, thick, and holds its shape.

        </li>
        <li>Transfer meringue to a piping bag. Pipe 12 bone shapes onto a prepared baking sheet. Pipe 12 puffs to resemble ghosts onto the remaining baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until dried and firm, about 1 hour. Turn off the oven, close the door, and cool until completely dried, about 1 hour more.

        </li>
        <li>Dip the tip of a toothpick into melted chocolate and dot chocolate "eyes" on each of the ghosts.

        </li>

    </ol>
