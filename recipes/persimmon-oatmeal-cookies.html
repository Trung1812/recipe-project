    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p><em>A great fall cookie but can really be enjoyed any time of the year if there's a supply of persimmon pulp in the freezer!  </em>  </p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups rolled oats        </li>
        <li>1 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour            </li>
        <li>½ cup English toffee-flavored baking bits (such as Heath®)</li>
        <li>  1 teaspoon baking soda        </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt        </li>
        <li> 1 cup brown sugar        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. </li>
        
        <li> Whisk oats, flour, toffee bits, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves together in a bowl.        </li>
        
        <li>  Beat brown sugar and butter together in a bowl with an electric mixer until creamy, 2 minutes. Beat in egg. Beat persimmon puree and vanilla into butter mixture.    </li>

        <li>   Mix flour mixture into persimmon mixture until dough is just moistened and no streaks of flour or oats remain. Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 1/2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.        </li>

        <li>  Bake cookies in the preheated oven until slightly browned on the edges, 8 to 12 minutes. Cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.        </li>

    </ol>
